# Project Overview

The US National Healthcare Organization aims to enhance healthcare delivery by analyzing patient data across various areas. This project leverages Power BI to visualize and interpret data, facilitating informed decision-making for stakeholders.

---

# Business Problem

The organization faced challenges understanding patient demographics, treatment outcomes, and resource allocation. There was a need for a centralized dashboard to:

* Identify prevalent medical conditions.
* Analyze treatment costs and lengths of stay.
* Understand insurance coverage distributions.
* Monitor admission types and test results.

---

# Methodology

The project was executed using Microsoft Power BI, following these steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, corrected inconsistencies, and ensured data integrity.

2. **Data Transformation**: Created calculated columns for metrics like age group and length of stay

3. **Feature Selection**: Identified relevant features for analysis, including medical conditions, admission types, and test results.

4. **Visualization**: Developed interactive charts and graphs to represent key metrics and trends.

5. **Dashboard Design**: Structured the dashboard into sections for patient information and diagnostics, incorporating slicers for dynamic filtering.

# Dataset

The project utilized a dataset from Onyx data containing information on 55,500 patients, organized in 17 columns. These columns include various information, including: Patient age, gender, blood type, medical conditions, admission type, test results, and insurance providers

---

Key Insights

* The majority of patients fall within the 50â€“59 age group.
* Diabetes and hypertension are the most prevalent medical conditions.
* Medicare covers over 50% of the patient population.
* Abnormal and inconclusive test results constitute 91% of all tests.
* Elective and urgent admissions are more common than emergency admissions.

---

# Recommendations
Based on the analysis and insights, the following recommendations were made for improving patient outcomes
* Implement targeted programs for managing chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension.
* Enhance diagnostic procedures to reduce the rate of inconclusive test results.
* Evaluate resource allocation to address the high volume of elective and urgent admissions.
* Consider expanding insurance partnerships to diversify coverage options for patients.
